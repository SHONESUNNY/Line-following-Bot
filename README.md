# Line-following-Bot
Working Principle :  
1. Line Detection - IR sensors detect black and white surfaces to determine the 
robotâ€™s position on the track 
2. Decision Making - The robot follows a predefined Left-Hand Rule Algorithm, 
where it turns left whenever possible to navigate the maze. 
3. Motor Control - Based on sensor inputs, the microcontroller adjusts the motor 
speeds to ensure smooth movement. 
4. Path Optimization - The system memorizes the path and eliminates 
unnecessary turns in future runs.
